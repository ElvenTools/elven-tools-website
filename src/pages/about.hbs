    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Elven Tools is a promotional website for the Open Source tooling around the NFT and MultiversX blockchain.</p>
    <p>For now the toolset includes three parts</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The custom Smart Contract.</li>
        <li>The CLI tool - allows interacting with the Smart Contract and aggregating data, like collection owners.</li>
        <li>The Minter Dapp - can be used as the base for the NFT launch website (NextJS-based).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Elven Tools is still a product where there is a lot to improve. It is why you should use it for production only
        when you understand the code and know what you are doing.</p>
    <p>I work with MultiversX in my free time. I don't have any interest in making money on it. But of course, I need to
        eat ;) So I spend most of my
        time doing commercial work unrelated to the blockchain and MultiversX. If you would like to see more Open Source
        stuff from me, consider supporting me with a small amount of EGLD. Here is my wallet address:
        <code>erd1qp2mm35kl65fvzzn98tgfuswrypq8xjgqpqc22az4jm6xt48aljsx5f8gw</code> (elventools.elrond)
    </p>
    <p>The next important thing is your feedback. Without it, I won't know what you need. Don't be afraid to ask about
        anything. I had a lot of interesting chats with people who were not so techy, but they told me about many
        good features. Without them, I would probably even haven't thought about the stuff. So please leave your
        question in the GitHub repositories or on Twitter. Write e-mails to me. Please do :)
