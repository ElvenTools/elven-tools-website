    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
        Elven Tools offers a suite of Open Source tools designed for use with the NFT and MultiversX blockchain
        platforms. Currently, the toolkit comprises three main components.</p>
    <p>For now the toolset includes three parts</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Smart contracts for NFTs and SFTs.</li>
        <li>The CLI tool - allows interacting with the Smart Contract and aggregating data, like collection owners.</li>
        <li>The Minter Dapp - can be used as the base for the NFT launch website (NextJS-based).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Elven Tools is still a product where there is a lot to improve. It is why you should use it for production only
        when you understand the code and know what you are doing.</p>
    <p>The next important thing is your feedback. Without it, I won't know what you need. Don't be afraid to ask about
        anything. I had a lot of interesting chats with people who were not so techy, but they told me about many
        good features. Without them, I would probably even haven't thought about the stuff. So please leave your
        question in the GitHub repositories or on X. Write e-mails to me. Please do :)
    </p>

    <h1 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: 2024-07-14</p>

    <p>
        By using Elven Tools, you acknowledge and agree to the terms outlined in
        this disclaimer. Elven Tools is designed to facilitate transactions on
        the MultiversX blockchain including custom smart contracts. While we strive to provide a seamless and
        secure experience, it is crucial to understand the inherent risks
        associated with blockchain transactions and the use of our tools.
    </p>

    <p>No Liability</p>
    <p>
        Elven Tools and its developers, affiliates, or agents will not be liable
        for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or any other
        damages arising out of or in connection with your use of this
        website/app/tools or any transaction conducted through it on the MultiversX
        blockchain mainnet. This includes, but is not limited to, loss of data,
        income, profit, or opportunity, as well as any other possible damages,
        even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.
    </p>

    <p>Testing on Devnet</p>
    <p>
        We strongly advise all users to thoroughly test their transactions/setup on
        the MultiversX blockchain devnet before executing them on the mainnet.
        The devnet provides a safe environment to ensure the intended outcomes
        of your transactions without risking real assets. Failure to test on the
        devnet first may result in unexpected outcomes for which Elven Tools
        bears no responsibility.
    </p>

    <p>Open Source Software</p>
    <p>
        The source code for Elven Tools is openly available for review. We
        encourage all users to inspect and analyze the code to understand its
        functionality fully and assess its security before use. The open-source
        nature of our platform is intended to foster transparency and trust;
        however, it is the user&apos;s responsibility to ensure they are
        satisfied with the software&apos;s safety and reliability before
        engaging in any transactions.
    </p>

    <p>Your Responsibility</p>
    <p>
        As a user, you bear full responsibility for all transactions you execute
        using Elven Tools and the MultiversX blockchain. You are urged to
        exercise caution, perform due diligence, and consider the risks involved
        in blockchain transactions.
    </p>

    <p>
        By continuing to use Elven Tools, you agree to this disclaimer and
        acknowledge understanding the risks involved.

    <p>
        Welcome to Elven Tools, a digital platform dedicated to enabling
        NFT/SFT management on MultiversX. At
        Elven Tools, we prioritize your privacy and are committed to protecting
        it. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of information we do not

        any third-party involvement.
    </p>

        Elven Tools is designed to operate without the need to collect personal
        information from its users. Our services allow you to perform
        transactions on MultiversX directly within your browser or smart contracts that you will own. We do not have
        a backend infrastructure, and we do not store, process, or transmit any
        personal data.
    </p>

    <p>Cookies</p>
    <p>
        Elven Tools does not use cookies. We believe in providing a seamless
        experience that respects your privacy, which means you can use our
        services without worrying about tracking or storage of cookies on your

    </p>

    <p>No Third-Party Sharing</p>
    <p>
        Given our operational model, there is no collection of personal
        information, and thus, no sharing of such information with third
        parties.
    </p>

    <p>
        Elven Tools reserves the right to modify this privacy policy at any time.
