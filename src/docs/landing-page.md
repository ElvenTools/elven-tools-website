Landing page based on the [Next](https://nextjs.org/) framework.

<div class="docs-info-box">
  The landing page template is still in progress. ETA moved to: 08 Apr 2022!
</div>

### Why Next?

There are a couple of reasons, the most important are:

1. Based on React, which is well known and most popular
2. Offers static sites generation or/and server-side rendering. Very important when it comes to landing pages and SEO.
3. Optimized with the Web Standards in mind. There are many tools for optimizing the assets loading and overall performance.
4. Simple PWA and Service Workers configuration is essential for optimization.
5. A lot of plugins and excellent development experience.

### What will you get with the initial version?

1. Nextjs template to clone and use.
2. Configuration for custom API endpoint, which will be proxied and hidden
3. Only your dapp will use the API endpoint (valid only for custom API, not Elrond public API)
4. There will be no dapp-core. Only simplified version. You will get three auth possibilities (maiar mobile app, browser extension, and web wallet). The Ledger will be implemented later.
5. You will get the initial version of the UI, it should be clean and pleasant, but it will be improved later.
6. You will get React hooks for transactions and smart contract queries. All prepared for Elven Tools smart contract, but you can always treat it as an example and adjust it for your needs.
7. Frontend optimizations. PWA and service workers, plus SWR fetch library cache strategies.
8. Basic documentation.

### What will you get with the following versions?

1. Better UI.
2. More React hooks and tooling.
3. Ledger Nano auth.
4. Better docs and clarifying best practices.
5. More walkthrough videos.
6. Update for the erdjs 10.* which will bring different approaches to the auth process and handling the transactions.
6. Split into the: auth and transaction handling npm package for usage in many different dapps.

### Stay tuned!
